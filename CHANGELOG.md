# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Maintainer tooling: `update-psl.py` now writes the changelog entry for a refresh. It diffs the bundled list against the freshly downloaded one as sets of rules, so a rule that only moved is not reported, collapses a parent suffix that gained five or more rules into a single count, and appends one bullet under **Unreleased**. `test_update_psl.py` covers the diff, the grouping, the rendering and the changelog surgery without touching the network, and the refresh workflow runs it before the download.

## [4.0.5] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- The bundled Public Suffix List is refreshed. `xnbay.com`, `u2.xnbay.com`, `u2-local.xnbay.com`, `demo.datacenter.fi` and `paas.datacenter.fi` are no longer rules, so hosts under them now parse as registrable domains under `com` and `fi`. Seventy-one regional `<region>-01.azurewebsites.net` rules and the `*.p.azurewebsites.net` wildcard are added, along with `*.eth.limo`, `*.eth.link`, `*.builtwithrocket.new`, `canva-code.cn`, `opencloud.me`, `rocketpreview.app`, `tmp.now` and `ia.bo`.

## [4.0.4] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- The bundled Public Suffix List is refreshed. `aivencloud.com` is no longer a rule of its own, so the bare host now parses as a registrable domain under `com`; the `*.aivencloud.com` wildcard is unchanged. `claudeusercontent.com` and `frame.claudeusercontent.com` are added.

### Fixed

- Maintainer tooling: the performance measurements no longer fail the Linux test job. Apple's XCTest treats a relative standard deviation over its 10% limit as information when no baseline is recorded, but swift-corelibs-xctest fails the test and offers no API to relax the limit, so a single slow iteration on a shared runner turned the build red. On Linux the blocks now run once untimed, which keeps the assertions inside them - the only coverage the extraction paths have - while giving up only the timing. This had already cost a week of Public Suffix List updates, since the weekly refresh workflow gates its pull request on `swift test` in a Linux container.
- Maintainer tooling: the simulator test jobs retry once when `xcodebuild` aborts with exit code 134, which the simulator does during teardown after every test has already run. Any other non-zero status still fails the job immediately.

## [4.0.3] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Maintainer tooling: `CLAUDE.md` records how the two simulator CI flakes present and how to tell them apart, and why `.spi.yml` changes take up to a day to show on the Swift Package Index page. The lint job gains the `timeout-minutes` the other jobs already had.

### Removed

- The hardcoded "Language: Swift 5.9" README badge. It duplicated the Swift Package Index Swift version badge, which reports the versions the package actually builds against instead of a number kept up to date by hand.

### Fixed

- The author line on the Swift Package Index page reads as a sentence again. SPI renders `metadata.authors` from `.spi.yml` verbatim, without the "Written by" prefix and full stop it adds to the line it derives from the commit history, so the value now carries them itself.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- A weekly workflow that refreshes the bundled Public Suffix List, runs the test suite against the new data, and opens a pull request when it changed.
- Swift Package Index listing, with an `.spi.yml` that has SPI build and host the DocC documentation alongside the GitHub Pages site and sets the author line shown on the package page. The README gains the SPI Swift version and platform compatibility badges.

### Changed

- The bundled Public Suffix List is refreshed. `public_suffix_list_frozen.dat` and the `SPM_PSL` literal had not been regenerated since August 2024, so `useFrozenData: true` was resolving against a two-year-old list; `update-psl.py` now writes all three bundled copies from a single download.
- `update-psl.py` requires Python 3 (the Python 2 branch is gone) and reports any rule it cannot punycode instead of failing silently.

### Fixed

- Maintainer tooling: the `set_version` / `bump_version` fastlane lanes accept `version:` / `type:` arguments and fail without a TTY instead of silently leaving the version untouched, and the version format check is anchored so that values such as `1a2b3` are rejected instead of written to the project.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Carthage: the Punycode dependency in the Cartfile is raised to 4.0, and the resolved version is updated to PunycodeSwift 4.0.1.

### Fixed

- Framework builds set `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY`, so linking the framework from an app extension no longer emits a "not safe for use in application extensions" warning ([#10](https://github.com/futamura/TLDExtractSwift/issues/10)). Not applicable to SPM consumers.

### Removed

- The Xcode script build phases that reformatted sources and regenerated the bundled Public Suffix List on every build. Builds no longer mutate the working tree (and no longer emit script-sandboxing warnings); refresh the bundled list explicitly with `python update-psl.py`.
- Leftover SwiftLint and Hound configuration (linting is enforced via swift-format) and the obsolete `.swift-version` file.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Linux support, verified by CI (`swift build` / `swift test` on the official Swift container).
- GitHub Releases are now created automatically when a version tag is pushed.
- `CI Success` aggregate check for branch protection.
- Community files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue and PR templates.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `Package.swift` requires swift-tools 5.9 (Xcode 15 or later for SPM consumers) and declares explicit platforms: macOS 10.13, iOS 12, tvOS 12, watchOS 4, visionOS 1.
- **Breaking**: the PunycodeSwift dependency is raised to 4.0 (`.upToNextMajor(from: "4.0.0")`), which adds the URL-aware `idnaEncodedURL` / `idnaDecodedURL` API.
- Product bundle identifiers renamed from `com.gumob.*` to `dev.futamura.*`, completing the account rename.
- CI runs on pushes and pull requests to `main` and `develop`, on current macOS runner images, resolving simulator destinations at runtime.
- API documentation migrated from jazzy to DocC, built and deployed to GitHub Pages by CI; the generated site is no longer tracked in the repository. New URL: <https://futamura.github.io/TLDExtractSwift/documentation/tldextractswift/>.
- Releasing is now a separate tag-triggered workflow that verifies the tag against the project version before publishing. Version tags are immutable.
- Development tooling: Ruby 3.4 / Bundler 2.7, gems updated to clear all outstanding Dependabot alerts.

### Fixed

- The README example that applied `idnaEncoded` to a full URL (which mangles the scheme into the first label) now encodes the host component correctly ([#8](https://github.com/futamura/TLDExtractSwift/issues/8)).

### Deprecated

- Carthage support is best-effort and no longer CI-verified.

### Removed

- CocoaPods publishing: 3.0.0 is the last version available as the `TLDExtractSwift` pod (the trunk becomes read-only on 2026-12-02 anyway). Later versions are distributed via Swift Package Manager (and Carthage on a best-effort basis). The podspec, the pod lint CI job, and the trunk push in the release workflow are removed.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-08-28

### Added

- watchOS and visionOS support.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Module renamed from `TLDExtract` to `TLDExtractSwift` to resolve a namespace conflict between the module and its main class ([apple/swift#56573](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/56573)). Update your imports: `import TLDExtractSwift`.
- Raised deployment targets: macOS 10.13, iOS 12.0, tvOS 12.0.
- Dropped Swift 4 support.

## [2.1.1] - 2024-08-23

### Changed

- Aligned platforms and dependencies in `Package.swift` with the podspec.
- Project maintenance: CI and dependency updates.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-06-24

### Added

- Swift Package Manager support, including an embedded Public Suffix List snapshot for SPM builds.

### Changed

- Tooling and CI maintenance (SwiftLint, gems, CocoaPods lint settings).

## [2.0.0] - 2019-08-09

### Added

- Swift 5 support.
- tvOS support (tvOS 11 and earlier included).

## [1.0.1] - 2018-11-21

### Fixed

- Documentation and packaging fixes.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-11-21

### Added

- Initial release: extraction of root domain, top-level domain, second-level domain, and subdomain from URLs and hostnames using the Public Suffix List, with IDNA support.
