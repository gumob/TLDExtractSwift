# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

TLDExtractSwift — a pure Swift library that extracts the top-level domain, second-level domain, subdomain, and root domain from a hostname or URL using the Public Suffix List (PSL), including IDNA/internationalized domains. Depends on PunycodeSwift (`Punycode` module) for IDNA encoding. Supports macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and Linux (SPM builds). Distributed via SPM. Carthage compatibility is best-effort (not CI-verified); CocoaPods distribution has ended (3.0.0 is the last version published under the pod name `TLDExtractSwift`).

## Commands

```bash
# Build and test (SPM)
swift build
swift test

# Run a single test method
swift test --filter TLDExtractSwiftTests/<testMethodName>

# Lint (enforced in CI via swift-format, not SwiftLint)
swift-format lint --ignore-unparsable-files --configuration .swift-format --recursive Sources Tests

# Update the bundled Public Suffix List (rewrites the .dat resources, SPMPSL.swift and CHANGELOG.md)
python update-psl.py

# Test the refresh script (pure helpers only; no network)
python -m unittest discover -p "test_*.py"

# Fastlane lanes (require `bundle install` first; Ruby/Python managed by mise)
bundle exec fastlane tests            # xcodebuild tests on all platforms (macOS/iOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS) + slather coverage
bundle exec fastlane lint_swift       # swift-format lint
bundle exec fastlane build_spm        # swift build + test
bundle exec fastlane build_carthage   # Carthage builds per platform
bundle exec fastlane gen_docs         # DocC static site into docc-site/ (via scripts/gen_docs.sh)
bundle exec fastlane set_version      # prompt for version; sets MARKETING_VERSION in the pbxproj
bundle exec fastlane set_version version:4.0.2   # non-interactive form
bundle exec fastlane bump_version     # patch/minor/major bump; same effect
bundle exec fastlane bump_version type:patch     # non-interactive form

# Interactive job menu (fzf)
./run.sh
```

Xcode-based test for a specific platform (what CI runs):

```bash
xcodebuild -project TLDExtractSwift.xcodeproj -scheme TLDExtractSwift -destination "platform=macOS" clean test
```

Note: `swift test` requires network access — the test suite initializes `TLDExtract(useFrozenData: false)`, which downloads the live PSL (see below).

## Architecture

Source files in `Sources/`:

- `TLDExtract.swift` — the public API: `TLDExtract` class (`init(useFrozenData:)` loads and parses the PSL; `parse(_:quick:)` returns a `TLDResult?`), the `TLDExtractable` protocol with `URL`/`String` conformances (hostname extraction via regex), and the `TLDResult` struct (`rootDomain` / `topLevelDomain` / `secondLevelDomain` / `subDomain`).
- `Parser.swift` — `PSLParser` (parses raw PSL text into a `PSLDataSet` of exceptions / wildcards / normals) and `TLDParser` (`parseExceptionsAndWildcards` matches rule-based entries; `parseNormals` matches plain suffixes by iterating host components from the right).
- `Model.swift` — `PSLDataSet`, `PSLData` (one PSL rule: exception flag, dot-split parts, priority for rule precedence), `PSLDataPart` (`.wildcard` / `.characters`).
- `SPMPSL.swift` — `SPM_PSL`, a frozen copy of the PSL embedded as a Swift string literal (~10k lines, compiled only under `SWIFT_PACKAGE`).
- `Extension.swift` — internal helpers (`Bundle.current`, `String.isComment`).
- `TLDExtractError.swift` — `TLDExtractError.pslParseError`.
- `TLDExtractSwift.h` — umbrella header for framework (non-SPM) builds.

### PSL data loading (two build paths)

`TLDExtract.init` branches on `#if SWIFT_PACKAGE`:

- **SPM build**: `useFrozenData: true` uses the embedded `SPM_PSL` string; `false` (default) synchronously downloads https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat at init. During parsing, each PSL line is additionally registered in its IDNA-encoded form via PunycodeSwift (`line.idnaEncoded`).
- **Framework build** (Xcode/Carthage): loads `Resources/public_suffix_list.dat` (or `public_suffix_list_frozen.dat` when `useFrozenData: true`) from the framework bundle via `Bundle.current`. No IDNA pass at parse time — punycoded rules are pre-baked into the `.dat` file.

`update-psl.py` downloads the latest PSL, strips comments and blank lines, inserts a punycode-encoded variant after each internationalized rule, and writes the result to all three bundled copies: `Resources/public_suffix_list.dat`, `Resources/public_suffix_list_frozen.dat`, and the `SPM_PSL` literal in `Sources/SPMPSL.swift` (substituted in place, so the file's header is preserved). The three therefore hold identical data; `useFrozenData` selects between a bundled snapshot and a live download only on the SPM path.

The script also writes the changelog entry. It reads the bundled `.dat` before overwriting it — that file is the only record of the previous snapshot — diffs the two as sets of rules, so a rule that merely moved is not reported, and puts one bullet under **Unreleased** / **Changed** in `CHANGELOG.md`. Rules are named individually until `GROUP_THRESHOLD` (5) of them share a parent suffix, at which point the group collapses to `71 rules under \`azurewebsites.net\`` — a registry that adds one rule per region would otherwise bury the section. The punycoded variant the script itself appends after an internationalized rule is dropped from the additions. Each refresh appends its own bullet rather than replacing the one before it, and that is deliberate: the diff is taken against the bundled list, so a second refresh landing before a release reports only what changed since the first, and replacing would drop the first refresh's rules from the release notes. A run that finds the list unchanged writes nothing, so re-running never stacks a duplicate. The wording is generated, so reword it when a change deserves more than the rule names.

`test_update_psl.py` covers those helpers — the diff, the grouping, the rendering and the changelog surgery — with no network and no writes; it loads the script by path because `update-psl.py` is not an importable module name. `update-psl.yml` runs it before the refresh.

`.github/workflows/update-psl.yml` runs the script weekly (Monday 03:00 UTC, plus manual dispatch). When the list changed it runs `swift test` in the `swift:6.2` container against the refreshed data and opens a pull request against `develop` only if those tests pass. That in-workflow run is a gate in its own right, and it is worth keeping green for that reason: a failure there means no pull request at all, so a flaky test silently costs a week of updates.

The pull request is opened with the `PSL_UPDATE_TOKEN` secret, a fine-grained PAT scoped to this repository (Contents and Pull requests read and write) that was registered on 2026-09-01 and **expires on 2027-09-01**. Renew it before then: the workflow reads `${{ secrets.PSL_UPDATE_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, and `||` falls back only on an empty value, so an expired token is still used, fails with 401, and stops the weekly refresh rather than degrading to `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The fallback exists because a pull request opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger workflows and therefore carries no checks; if you ever see such a pull request, the secret is gone or expired.

Tests live in `Tests/TLDExtractSwiftTests.swift` (single XCTest file; SPM test target name is `TLDExtractSwiftTests`). Note how little of it XCTest actually discovers: `testExtractableString`, `testExtractableURL`, `testTLDExtractString` and `testTLDExtractURL` take `file`/`line` arguments, so they are not `() -> Void` and never run as tests of their own. The `testMeasure*` methods are their only callers, which makes those four blocks the entire coverage of the extraction paths — deleting or platform-gating a measurement silently removes it. Run the suite and check the executed count (six, not two) after touching them.

## Versioning and release

- Single source of truth for the version: `MARKETING_VERSION` in `TLDExtractSwift.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. Never edit versions by hand — use `fastlane set_version` / `bump_version`. Both lanes prompt only when stdin is a TTY; without one, pass `version:` / `type:` or the lane fails rather than silently leaving the version untouched.
- Branch flow: work on `develop`, PR into `main`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) runs on push and pull request to `main`/`develop`: swift-format lint → per-platform xcodebuild tests (simulator devices resolved at runtime via `simctl`) → SPM (macOS + Linux via the official Swift container). It does not release. Carthage builds are not CI-verified (best-effort compatibility via the Xcode project). The `CI Success` job aggregates all results and is the required status check on `main`.
- The simulator jobs flake in two ways, neither of which is a problem with the code: they finish every test and then abort during teardown with exit code 134, or they hang and get cancelled on the job's `timeout-minutes` (15 for the simulator matrix, 10 for the macOS, Catalyst and SPM jobs). The 134 abort is retried once by the job itself; any other non-zero status fails immediately, so a real failure is never retried into a pass. A timeout is not retried. `gh pr checks` reports both as `fail`; `gh api repos/futamura/TLDExtractSwift/actions/jobs/<job-id> --jq .conclusion` tells them apart, since a timeout shows `cancelled` and the abort shows `failure`. Rerun with `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` rather than debugging the tests.
- Performance measurements are gated on the platform, and the reason is not cosmetic. Apple's XCTest treats a relative standard deviation over its 10% limit as information when no baseline is recorded, and none is; swift-corelibs-xctest fails the test instead and exposes no API to relax the limit (`measureMetrics(_:automaticallyStartMeasuring:file:line:for:)` is all there is, and `maxRelativeStandardDeviation` is internal). One slow iteration on a shared runner is enough — a 0.448s outlier among nine iterations between 0.104s and 0.137s produced a 71% deviation and a red build — and because the refresh workflow gates on `swift test` in a Linux container, that cost a week of Public Suffix List updates in August 2026. `measureIfSupported` therefore runs the blocks untimed on Linux, keeping the assertions inside them. Reproduce Linux behaviour locally with `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/package" -w /package swift:6.2 swift test -c debug`, and mind that piping it through `tail` hides the exit status.
- Documentation (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) builds the DocC site with `scripts/gen_docs.sh` (symbolgraph-extract with `-emit-extension-block-symbols` — required because part of the public API is extensions on URL/String — then `docc convert`) and deploys it to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. The site is not tracked in git; `docs/` no longer exists.
- Swift Package Index: `.spi.yml` has SPI build and host its own copy of the DocC documentation (`custom_documentation_parameters: [--include-extended-types]` is required — without it the extensions on URL/String, which are part of the public API, are dropped) and sets the author line via `metadata.authors`, which SPI would otherwise derive from the commit history and credit to the former `gumob` handle. SPI renders `metadata.authors` verbatim, so the value has to be a complete sentence: the `Written by ` prefix and the full stop are added only to the line it derives itself.
- Changes to `.spi.yml` reach the package page slowly, and this is by design rather than a fault to chase: `Analyze.throttle` in SwiftPackageIndex-Server keeps the stored default-branch version until its commit is older than `Constants.branchVersionRefreshDelay` (24 hours), and the author line reads `defaultBranchVersion.spiManifest`. Merging again does not restart that clock — it runs from the commit SPI already holds — but the refresh, when it happens, picks up the newest commit, so queued changes land together. Tags are not throttled, which is why a release shows up on the page the same day.
- Releasing is a separate, explicit step: push a bare version tag (e.g. `4.0.1`) matching `MARKETING_VERSION`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` then verifies the tag against the project version and creates a GitHub Release (notes taken from the tag's `CHANGELOG.md` section, falling back to generated notes). Use `./run.sh` → "Github - Update tag" to create the tag (it refuses to retag an existing version).
- Version tags are immutable: the release workflow fails if the tag already exists. To re-release, bump the version — never delete/re-push a tag.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format) current: user-facing changes go under **Unreleased**; when releasing, rename that section to the new version with the date and add its compare link. The release workflow extracts this section for the GitHub Release notes.
